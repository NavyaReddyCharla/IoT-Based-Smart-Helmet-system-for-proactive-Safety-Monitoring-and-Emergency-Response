# IoT Based Smart Helmet System for Proactive Safety Monitoring and Emergency Response

An IoT-based smart helmet designed to improve two-wheeler rider safety by ensuring helmet usage, detecting alcohol consumption, and providing automatic accident alerts with real-time location tracking.

## 📌 Project Description
Nowadays, road accidents involving two-wheelers are increasing due to lack of helmet usage and drunk driving.  
This project proposes an IoT-based Smart Helmet System that ensures rider safety by allowing vehicle ignition only when the helmet is worn and alcohol is not detected.

In case of an accident, the system automatically detects the crash and sends the rider’s real-time GPS location to pre-stored emergency contacts using GSM. Rider safety data is also uploaded to the cloud for continuous monitoring.

## ✨ Features
- Helmet wearing detection
- Alcohol consumption detection
- Automatic accident detection
- Emergency alert with GPS location via GSM
- Panic button for manual emergency alert
- Buzzer alert system
- Cloud-based rider safety monitoring
- Vehicle ignition control using relay

## 🛠 Hardware Components Used
- ESP32 / Arduino Microcontroller  
- Alcohol Sensor  
- Accident Sensor  
- GPS Module  
- GSM Module  
- Relay Module  
- Buzzer  
- LCD Display  
- Panic Button  
- Power Supply / Battery  
- Motor  
- Smart Helmet  

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- IoT Technology
- Embedded Systems
- Arduino Programming
- GPS & GSM Communication

## ▶ How the System Works
1. The helmet checks whether the rider is wearing it.
2. Alcohol sensor detects alcohol consumption.
3. Vehicle ignition is enabled only if safety conditions are met.
4. Accident sensor detects crash situations.
5. GPS and GSM modules send real-time location to emergency contacts.
6. Safety data is uploaded to the cloud for monitoring.
